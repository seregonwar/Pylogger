# Keylogger-by-seregon

## Keylogger
A Python script that logs keystrokes and uploads them to Dropbox.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/seregonwar/keylogger.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add your Dropbox access token to the `TOKEN` variable in `keylogger.py`.

## Usage
4. Run the script: `python keylogger.py`
5. The script will create a new file named `keylogger1.txt` in the same directory as the script.
6. The script will log all keystrokes until the file size reaches 1 MB, then upload the file to Dropbox and create a new file named `keylogger2.txt`.
7. The script will continue to log keystrokes every 30 minutes and upload the files to Dropbox.

## Notes
- The script uses the pynput library to monitor keystrokes. Make sure to run the script with administrative privileges to allow access to keyboard input.
- The script requires a Dropbox access token to upload files. You can obtain an access token from the Dropbox Developer Console.
- The script logs keystrokes in plain text, so be careful not to enter sensitive information while the script is running.
